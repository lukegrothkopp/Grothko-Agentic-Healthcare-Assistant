Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined by persistent kidney damage or reduced eGFR (<60) for â‰¥3 months.
Management often includes blood pressure control, glucose management, ACEi/ARB, SGLT2 inhibitors, and risk-based referral to nephrology.
Lifestyle measures (salt restriction, exercise, smoking cessation) and vaccinations help reduce complications.
